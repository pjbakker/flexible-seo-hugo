## Installation

    $ mkdir themes
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/pjbakker/flexible-seo-hugo.git themes/flexible-seo-hugo

## About

This theme has been built upon Bootstrap 4. It allows you to easily switch between different Navigation bars, Page Headers and Footers using configuration. And of course you can add your own as well.

All core pages have been optimized for SEO-friendliness.

Of course there is also support for:

* Google Analytics
* Easily switching navigation, header and footer templates
* SEO friendly list pages (No auto-generated lists!)
* Auto generated breadcrumbs (both visible and structured data)

## Switching navigation, header or footer

Within your `config.toml` add the according parameter you want the theme to use. By default, the theme uses 'simple' for home, navigation, header and footer.

~~~
[Params]
  homeType = "simple"
  navType = "simple"
  headerType = "simple"
  taxonomyHeaderType = "simple"
  footerType = "simple"
~~~

You can set headerType on a page level!

The theme will look for the theme parts in *layouts/partials/navs/*, *layouts/partials/headers/*, and *layouts/partials/footers/* accordingly. For instance, with `nav = "simple"`, it will look for *layouts/partials/navs/simple.html*.

### Supported home styles

The following home page styles are included for **content/_index.md**:

* `bare`,  no scaffolding, giving you total control over the structure.
* `simple`, just a plain bootstrap row and col-8.
* `no_row`, just a bootstrap container, giving you full flexibility to fill the container.

In the `simple` home page style a list of Regular Pages (not the generated pages) is shown. You can disable this autogenerated list by specifying `showGeneratedList` to `false` in the Site or Page parameters. By setting `homeSections` in the Site parameters you can specify which sections should be shown on the home page. E.g. `homeSections = [ "posts" ]` will only show pages from the *posts* section. If `homeSections` is not specified, all RegularPages are shown.

### Supported page header styles

The following page header styles are included:

* `simple`, just a plain centered title and subtitle.
* `image_header`, a screen-wide header image (located in `headerImage`) with the title and subtitle on it.

### Supported footer styles

The following footer styles are included:

* `simple`, just a copyright statement and the option to have a limited number of links in the footer. Links are taken from .Params.footerLinks.
* `bar_with_2_columns`, a gray bar at the bottom with two columns (left aligned and right aligned). Links are taken from .Params.footerLinksColumn1 and .Params.footerLinksColumn2.

## Breadcrumbs

By default a breadcrumb bar is shown at the top of each page other than Home. You can disable showing the breadcrumb bar at a site or page level by setting `showBreadcrumbs` to `false`.

## CSS adaption

After Bootstrap and this theme's CSS file (*/static/css/theme.css*), the empty local CSS file (*/static/css/local.css*) is included which you can override in your own site.

## Enabling Analytics

Assuming you already signed up for [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/), you can add your Google Tracking ID to the `googleAnalytics` parameter in `config.toml`. It will then automatically include Google Analytics code in your site.

## Disqus support

When `DisqusShortname` is set in your site's config, all regular pages will have Disqus enabled at the bottom. You can disable this on a page-by-page basis by setting `comments` to `false` in a page's front matter.
